          Electricity is a production commodity due to its structure. Current
          technology to store it is not ready to scale to meet our grid based
          distribution technology. This state of affairs makes sales linked to
          consumption in most markets: nearly all electricity is sold and
          consumed at the same time.

            The world's diet for energy is in part due to the convenience of a
            grid. Most developing worlds do not have easy access to electricity
            to facilitate using a clothes dryer. Often they dry their clothes
            outside.
          </p>
          <p className="auth font-mont text-base md:text-lg font-medium">
            Being able to run a dryer 24/7/365 is part of the promise of a grid
            in the US, but a reluctant addition to a home ownerâ€™s solar system.
            Providing for a grid requires capacity for everything. In the US
            this results in many plants running at low (inefficient) power
            levels to stand by for demand loads. These plants are often coal
            fired, and even more inefficient (but less polluting) by running at
            standby.
